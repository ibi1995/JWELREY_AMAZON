# 2-The Economic Environment

## 1. Introduction
This chapter explores the broader economic environment of the financial services sector. It covers economic activity determination, economic systems, and key economic measures indicating the state of an economy.

## 2. Factors Determining Economic Activity
### 2.1.1 State-Controlled Economies
- State-controlled economies (planned/command economies) have the government deciding production and distribution.
- Examples include the Soviet Union, with perceived advantages such as low inequality but potential drawbacks like excessive bureaucracy.

### 2.2 Market Economies
- In market economies, supply and demand determine resource allocation.
- Businesses produce based on consumer demand, resulting in market-clearing prices.
- Competition influences the value of resources, and oversupply or undersupply affects prices.

### 2.3 Mixed Economies
- Combine market economy with state control.
- Governments provide welfare, public services, and regulate markets.
- A balance between market forces and social welfare.

### 2.4 Open Economies
- Few trade barriers or foreign exchange controls.
- Governments may use protectionism to preserve domestic markets.
- The World Trade Organization promotes free trade and resolves disputes.

## 3. The Economic Cycle and Economic Policy
### 3.1 Macroeconomic Objectives
- Full employment, economic growth, low inflation, and balance of payments equilibrium.
- Simultaneous achievement is challenging due to conflicting objectives.

### 3.2 Stages of the Economic Cycle
- Peak, Contraction, Trough, Expansion.
- Economic activity fluctuates, influencing GDP.

### 3.3 Fiscal Policy
- Government actions to influence the economy through spending and taxation.
- Tools include budget management and taxation policies.
- Impacts business planning, costs, and investments.

### 3.4 Monetary Policy
- Regulation of the economy through control of the money supply, interest rates, and credit availability.
- Influences spending, inflation, and economic activity.
- Tools include managing the money supply and setting interest rates.

## 4. Central Banks
### 4.1 The Role of Central Banks
- Central banks operate at the heart of a nation's financial system.
- Responsibilities include banking, government support, regulating the banking system, and setting interest rates.
- Examples include the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan.

## 5. Key Economic Indicators

### 5.1 Inflation
Inflation is a persistent increase in the general level of prices. Governments aim to control it at about 2â€“3% pa to avoid various negative consequences, such as eroded real salaries, decreased competitiveness in exports, and difficulties in assessing future pensions and investment income. High inflation, while having drawbacks, may contribute to a 'feel-good' factor and benefit borrowers.

### 5.1.1 Inflation Measures
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a common measure, tracking changes in prices of goods and services. It reflects the average price change, but individual experiences may vary. Various countries use different methods for calculating inflation, leading to alternative pictures of economic situations.

### 5.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
GDP is a key measure of economic output, calculated by summing consumer spending, government spending, investment, and net exports. Sustainable growth depends on factors like labor force growth, productivity, and infrastructure development. Fluctuations from trend growth create economic cycles.

### 5.3 Balance of Payments (BoP) and Exchange Rates
BoP summarizes a country's transactions with the world. A trade surplus or deficit impacts a country's economic position. Exchange rate changes influence competitiveness and trade balances. The exchange rate regime (fixed, floating, target zone, crawling peg, managed float) affects stability and interventions.

### 5.4 Budget Deficits and the National Debt
Government debt and budget deficits are crucial economic indicators. Debt is what the government owes, and the deficit is the annual shortfall between expenditure and income. Presented as a percentage of GDP, they impact economic stability, growth, and credit ratings.

### 5.5 Level of Unemployment
Unemployment reflects the health of the economy, with some unemployment considered natural. High unemployment negatively impacts government finances, leading to increased social payments and decreased tax revenues. Official figures may not capture gig economy trends accurately.

### 5.6 Exchange Rates
Exchange rates influence international trade and competitiveness. Volatile rates create uncertainty and affect economic activity. Fixed rate, floating rate, target zone, crawling peg, and managed float are different exchange rate regimes with varying impacts on stability and interventions.

- Each market has its own timeline for when this must happen (settlement cycle).

# 4-Bonds

## Introduction

Bonds, though not as media-highlighted as shares, constitute a larger global market with outstanding debt surpassing $120 trillion, compared to an equity market capitalization of nearly $109 trillion. The bond market is divided between government and corporate bonds, with substantial government bond issuance post-financial crisis.

## Characteristics of Bonds

### Definition of a Bond
A bond is essentially a tradeable loan, allowing an investor to lend money to a company or government in exchange for fixed interest payments and the return of the principal amount on a specified maturity date.

### Example: 1.875% Treasury Bond 2041
- **Nominal:** The amount of stock purchased (face value of the bond).
- **Stock:** Identifies the bond and the borrower (e.g., Treasury bond issued by the US government).
- **Coupon:** Annual interest paid as a percentage of the face value.
- **Redemption Date:** Date when the bond matures, and the principal is repaid.
- **Price:** Market price per $100 nominal of stock.
- **Value:** Calculated by multiplying the nominal amount by the current price.

## Advantages, Disadvantages, and Risks

### Advantages
- Regular and certain income for fixed-interest bonds.
- Fixed maturity date.
- Various income yields to suit different investment and tax situations.
- Relative security of capital for highly-rated bonds.

### Disadvantages
- Real value of income flow eroded by inflation (except for index-linked bonds).
- Bonds carry elements of risk.

### Risks
- Default risk (issuer might fail to repay capital).
- Price risk, influenced by interest rate movements.
- Early redemption risk.
- Seniority risk.
- Inflation risk.
- Liquidity risk.
- Exchange rate risk for bonds in foreign currencies.

As the examples illustrate, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices:
- If interest rates increase, bond prices will decrease.
- If interest rates decrease, bond prices will increase.

## Credit Rating Agencies

### Role of Credit Rating Agencies
Credit risk, or the likelihood of an issuer defaulting, is assessed through credit ratings provided by agencies like Standard & Poorâ€™s (S&P), Moodyâ€™s, and Fitch Ratings. These agencies assign ratings based on investment and non-investment grades.

### Bond Credit Ratings
- **Investment Grade:**
  - Highest quality to Medium grade (Aaa to A)
- **Non-Investment Grade:**
  - Lower medium grade to In default (Ba to D)

Ratings help categorize bonds into investment-grade (more secure) and non-investment-grade or speculative (higher risk) categories.

## Government Bonds

### US
The US government bond market (Treasuries) includes Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and inflation-protected securities (TIPS). US Treasuries are traded for settlement the next day.

### UK
UK government bonds (gilts) include conventional bonds and index-linked bonds. Gilts are classified by remaining years until redemption.

### Germany
German government bonds (Bunds, Schatz, Bobls) have varying maturities, with Bunds serving as benchmarks for European bonds. Settlement is electronic, with interest paid annually.

### China
China's bond market is diverse, including sovereign government bonds, policy bank bonds, and local government bonds. Inclusion in global indices reflects China's growing market.

### Japan
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) have various categories, including short-term, medium-term, and super-long-term bonds. Inflation-indexed bonds operate similarly to TIPS.

### Primary Market Issuance
Government bonds are typically issued through agencies like the Debt Management Office (DMO). Issuance often involves auctions where large investors bid competitively.

Issuers:
- US: Bureau of the Fiscal Service
- UK: Debt Management Office
- Germany: Finanzagentur GmbH
- China: Ministry of Finance
- Japan: Ministry of Finance

Government bonds play a crucial role in financing government spending and investment plans, and their characteristics, risks, and credit ratings impact investment decisions.

## Corporate Bonds 
- A corporate bond is a debt instrument issued by a company.
- Typically refers to longer-term debt with a maturity of more than 12 months.

## Commercial Paper vs. Corporate Bonds
- Commercial paper is used for shorter-term instruments, while corporate bonds are for longer-term debt.
- Companies with high credit ratings issue bonds with a maturity greater than ten years at an acceptable cost.

## Listing and Trading
- Most corporate bonds are listed on stock exchanges, but trading often occurs over-the-counter (OTC) directly between market counterparties.

## Features of Corporate Bonds
- Differentiated by security and redemption provisions.
- Security often involves a charge over the issuer's assets, providing a guarantee for bond repayment.
- Redemption provisions include call options for the issuer and put options for bondholders.

## Types of Corporate Debt
### Medium-Term Notes (MTNs)
- Offered continually over time by an agent instead of a single tranche.
- Maturities up to five years, sometimes up to 30 years.

### Fixed-Rate Bonds
- Fixed coupons paid half-yearly or annually with predetermined redemption dates.

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)
- Variable interest rates linked to benchmark rates like SOFR or SONIA.
- Interest paid at benchmark rate plus a quoted margin or spread.

### Convertible Bonds
- Investors can choose to collect interest or convert into a predefined number of ordinary shares.
- Provides potential for capital gains if the company prospers.

### Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)
- Pay no interest but issued at a discount to par value.
- Returns come from capital growth and may be treated differently for tax purposes.

## Example
- The example of Tesco issuing Medium-Term Notes with an investor put provision.
- Convertible bonds offer investors the choice of interest payments or converting into company shares.

Understanding these key points provides insights into the diverse features and types of corporate bonds and debt instruments.

## Asset-Backed Securities (ABSs)

### 1. Definition:
   - ABSs are bundled securities resulting from the packaging of non-marketable assets like mortgages, credit card debt, and accounts receivable.

### 2. Mortgage-Backed Securities:
   - Major market for mortgage-backed securities, originating from the securitization process.
   - Securitization began in the US in 1970 with mortgage certificates, spreading globally.

### 3. Securitization Process:
   - Mortgages packaged by a bank are sold to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).
   - SPV issues bonds with original mortgage security and credit enhancements to investors.

### 4. Advantages for Banks:
   - Increases total funding by accessing capital markets.
   - Diversifies risk exposure by removing mortgages from the balance sheet.
   - Improves liquidity position as securitization replaces long-term mortgages.

### 5. Benefits for Investors:
   - Offers marketable asset-backed instruments with periodic interest payments.
   - Original mortgages provide security if well diversified, and credit enhancements improve credit risk.

### 6. Drawback:
   - Vulnerability to poor-quality mortgages in the pool, as seen in the sub-prime crisis.
   - Sub-prime mortgages added to the pool led to bond price collapse and significant losses for investors.

## Covered Bonds

### 1. Definition:
   - Covered bonds are a variation of ABSs widely used in Europe.
   - Issued by financial institutions, backed by cash flows from a pool of mortgages or public sector loans.

### 2. Differences from ABSs:
   - Remain on the issuer's balance sheet.
   - Regulatory framework ensures compliance, making them particularly safe investments.
   - Asset pool must cover bondholder claims throughout the covered bond's term.
   - Bondholders have a priority claim on the cover asset pool in case of issuer default.

### 3. Importance in Europe:
   - Crucial for financing the mortgage and public sector markets in Europe.
   - Vital for the European banking sector's future and individuals' ability to finance house loans at reasonable rates.
