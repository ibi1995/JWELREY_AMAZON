# 2-The Economic Environment

## 1. Introduction
This chapter explores the broader economic environment of the financial services sector. It covers economic activity determination, economic systems, and key economic measures indicating the state of an economy.

## 2. Factors Determining Economic Activity
### 2.1.1 State-Controlled Economies
- State-controlled economies (planned/command economies) have the government deciding production and distribution.
- Examples include the Soviet Union, with perceived advantages such as low inequality but potential drawbacks like excessive bureaucracy.

### 2.2 Market Economies
- In market economies, supply and demand determine resource allocation.
- Businesses produce based on consumer demand, resulting in market-clearing prices.
- Competition influences the value of resources, and oversupply or undersupply affects prices.

### 2.3 Mixed Economies
- Combine market economy with state control.
- Governments provide welfare, public services, and regulate markets.
- A balance between market forces and social welfare.

### 2.4 Open Economies
- Few trade barriers or foreign exchange controls.
- Governments may use protectionism to preserve domestic markets.
- The World Trade Organization promotes free trade and resolves disputes.

## 3. The Economic Cycle and Economic Policy
### 3.1 Macroeconomic Objectives
- Full employment, economic growth, low inflation, and balance of payments equilibrium.
- Simultaneous achievement is challenging due to conflicting objectives.

### 3.2 Stages of the Economic Cycle
- Peak, Contraction, Trough, Expansion.
- Economic activity fluctuates, influencing GDP.

### 3.3 Fiscal Policy
- Government actions to influence the economy through spending and taxation.
- Tools include budget management and taxation policies.
- Impacts business planning, costs, and investments.

### 3.4 Monetary Policy
- Regulation of the economy through control of the money supply, interest rates, and credit availability.
- Influences spending, inflation, and economic activity.
- Tools include managing the money supply and setting interest rates.

## 4. Central Banks
### 4.1 The Role of Central Banks
- Central banks operate at the heart of a nation's financial system.
- Responsibilities include banking, government support, regulating the banking system, and setting interest rates.
- Examples include the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan.

## 5. Key Economic Indicators

### 5.1 Inflation
Inflation is a persistent increase in the general level of prices. Governments aim to control it at about 2â€“3% pa to avoid various negative consequences, such as eroded real salaries, decreased competitiveness in exports, and difficulties in assessing future pensions and investment income. High inflation, while having drawbacks, may contribute to a 'feel-good' factor and benefit borrowers.

### 5.1.1 Inflation Measures
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a common measure, tracking changes in prices of goods and services. It reflects the average price change, but individual experiences may vary. Various countries use different methods for calculating inflation, leading to alternative pictures of economic situations.

### 5.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
GDP is a key measure of economic output, calculated by summing consumer spending, government spending, investment, and net exports. Sustainable growth depends on factors like labor force growth, productivity, and infrastructure development. Fluctuations from trend growth create economic cycles.

### 5.3 Balance of Payments (BoP) and Exchange Rates
BoP summarizes a country's transactions with the world. A trade surplus or deficit impacts a country's economic position. Exchange rate changes influence competitiveness and trade balances. The exchange rate regime (fixed, floating, target zone, crawling peg, managed float) affects stability and interventions.

### 5.4 Budget Deficits and the National Debt
Government debt and budget deficits are crucial economic indicators. Debt is what the government owes, and the deficit is the annual shortfall between expenditure and income. Presented as a percentage of GDP, they impact economic stability, growth, and credit ratings.

### 5.5 Level of Unemployment
Unemployment reflects the health of the economy, with some unemployment considered natural. High unemployment negatively impacts government finances, leading to increased social payments and decreased tax revenues. Official figures may not capture gig economy trends accurately.

### 5.6 Exchange Rates
Exchange rates influence international trade and competitiveness. Volatile rates create uncertainty and affect economic activity. Fixed rate, floating rate, target zone, crawling peg, and managed float are different exchange rate regimes with varying impacts on stability and interventions.

- Each market has its own timeline for when this must happen (settlement cycle).

# 4-Bonds

## Introduction

Bonds, though not as media-highlighted as shares, constitute a larger global market with outstanding debt surpassing $120 trillion, compared to an equity market capitalization of nearly $109 trillion. The bond market is divided between government and corporate bonds, with substantial government bond issuance post-financial crisis.

## Characteristics of Bonds

### Definition of a Bond
A bond is essentially a tradeable loan, allowing an investor to lend money to a company or government in exchange for fixed interest payments and the return of the principal amount on a specified maturity date.

### Example: 1.875% Treasury Bond 2041
- **Nominal:** The amount of stock purchased (face value of the bond).
- **Stock:** Identifies the bond and the borrower (e.g., Treasury bond issued by the US government).
- **Coupon:** Annual interest paid as a percentage of the face value.
- **Redemption Date:** Date when the bond matures, and the principal is repaid.
- **Price:** Market price per $100 nominal of stock.
- **Value:** Calculated by multiplying the nominal amount by the current price.

## Advantages, Disadvantages, and Risks

### Advantages
- Regular and certain income for fixed-interest bonds.
- Fixed maturity date.
- Various income yields to suit different investment and tax situations.
- Relative security of capital for highly-rated bonds.

### Disadvantages
- Real value of income flow eroded by inflation (except for index-linked bonds).
- Bonds carry elements of risk.

### Risks
- Default risk (issuer might fail to repay capital).
- Price risk, influenced by interest rate movements.
- Early redemption risk.
- Seniority risk.
- Inflation risk.
- Liquidity risk.
- Exchange rate risk for bonds in foreign currencies.

As the examples illustrate, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices:
- If interest rates increase, bond prices will decrease.
- If interest rates decrease, bond prices will increase.

## Credit Rating Agencies

### Role of Credit Rating Agencies
Credit risk, or the likelihood of an issuer defaulting, is assessed through credit ratings provided by agencies like Standard & Poorâ€™s (S&P), Moodyâ€™s, and Fitch Ratings. These agencies assign ratings based on investment and non-investment grades.

### Bond Credit Ratings
- **Investment Grade:**
  - Highest quality to Medium grade (Aaa to A)
- **Non-Investment Grade:**
  - Lower medium grade to In default (Ba to D)

Ratings help categorize bonds into investment-grade (more secure) and non-investment-grade or speculative (higher risk) categories.

## Government Bonds

### US
The US government bond market (Treasuries) includes Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and inflation-protected securities (TIPS). US Treasuries are traded for settlement the next day.

### UK
UK government bonds (gilts) include conventional bonds and index-linked bonds. Gilts are classified by remaining years until redemption.

### Germany
German government bonds (Bunds, Schatz, Bobls) have varying maturities, with Bunds serving as benchmarks for European bonds. Settlement is electronic, with interest paid annually.

### China
China's bond market is diverse, including sovereign government bonds, policy bank bonds, and local government bonds. Inclusion in global indices reflects China's growing market.

### Japan
Japanese government bonds (JGBs) have various categories, including short-term, medium-term, and super-long-term bonds. Inflation-indexed bonds operate similarly to TIPS.

### Primary Market Issuance
Government bonds are typically issued through agencies like the Debt Management Office (DMO). Issuance often involves auctions where large investors bid competitively.

Issuers:
- US: Bureau of the Fiscal Service
- UK: Debt Management Office
- Germany: Finanzagentur GmbH
- China: Ministry of Finance
- Japan: Ministry of Finance

Government bonds play a crucial role in financing government spending and investment plans, and their characteristics, risks, and credit ratings impact investment decisions.

## Corporate Bonds 
- A corporate bond is a debt instrument issued by a company.
- Typically refers to longer-term debt with a maturity of more than 12 months.

## Commercial Paper vs. Corporate Bonds
- Commercial paper is used for shorter-term instruments, while corporate bonds are for longer-term debt.
- Companies with high credit ratings issue bonds with a maturity greater than ten years at an acceptable cost.

## Listing and Trading
- Most corporate bonds are listed on stock exchanges, but trading often occurs over-the-counter (OTC) directly between market counterparties.

## Features of Corporate Bonds
- Differentiated by security and redemption provisions.
- Security often involves a charge over the issuer's assets, providing a guarantee for bond repayment.
- Redemption provisions include call options for the issuer and put options for bondholders.

## Types of Corporate Debt
### Medium-Term Notes (MTNs)
- Offered continually over time by an agent instead of a single tranche.
- Maturities up to five years, sometimes up to 30 years.

### Fixed-Rate Bonds
- Fixed coupons paid half-yearly or annually with predetermined redemption dates.

### Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)
- Variable interest rates linked to benchmark rates like SOFR or SONIA.
- Interest paid at benchmark rate plus a quoted margin or spread.

### Convertible Bonds
- Investors can choose to collect interest or convert into a predefined number of ordinary shares.
- Provides potential for capital gains if the company prospers.

### Zero Coupon Bonds (ZCBs)
- Pay no interest but issued at a discount to par value.
- Returns come from capital growth and may be treated differently for tax purposes.

## Example
- The example of Tesco issuing Medium-Term Notes with an investor put provision.
- Convertible bonds offer investors the choice of interest payments or converting into company shares.

Understanding these key points provides insights into the diverse features and types of corporate bonds and debt instruments.

## Asset-Backed Securities (ABSs)

### 1. Definition:
   - ABSs are bundled securities resulting from the packaging of non-marketable assets like mortgages, credit card debt, and accounts receivable.

### 2. Mortgage-Backed Securities:
   - Major market for mortgage-backed securities, originating from the securitization process.
   - Securitization began in the US in 1970 with mortgage certificates, spreading globally.

### 3. Securitization Process:
   - Mortgages packaged by a bank are sold to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).
   - SPV issues bonds with original mortgage security and credit enhancements to investors.

### 4. Advantages for Banks:
   - Increases total funding by accessing capital markets.
   - Diversifies risk exposure by removing mortgages from the balance sheet.
   - Improves liquidity position as securitization replaces long-term mortgages.

### 5. Benefits for Investors:
   - Offers marketable asset-backed instruments with periodic interest payments.
   - Original mortgages provide security if well diversified, and credit enhancements improve credit risk.

### 6. Drawback:
   - Vulnerability to poor-quality mortgages in the pool, as seen in the sub-prime crisis.
   - Sub-prime mortgages added to the pool led to bond price collapse and significant losses for investors.

## Covered Bonds

### 1. Definition:
   - Covered bonds are a variation of ABSs widely used in Europe.
   - Issued by financial institutions, backed by cash flows from a pool of mortgages or public sector loans.

### 2. Differences from ABSs:
   - Remain on the issuer's balance sheet.
   - Regulatory framework ensures compliance, making them particularly safe investments.
   - Asset pool must cover bondholder claims throughout the covered bond's term.
   - Bondholders have a priority claim on the cover asset pool in case of issuer default.

### 3. Importance in Europe:
   - Crucial for financing the mortgage and public sector markets in Europe.
   - Vital for the European banking sector's future and individuals' ability to finance house loans at reasonable rates.
     
## International Bonds

### 1. Domestic and Foreign Bonds

International bonds can be categorized as domestic or foreign based on their geographical issuance. Domestic bonds are issued by entities within their own country, denominated in the domestic currency. Conversely, foreign bonds are issued by overseas entities into a domestic market and are denominated in the domestic currency.


**Domestic Bonds:**
- Issued locally by a domestic entity.
- Denominated in the local currency.

**Foreign Bonds:**
- Issued by overseas entities in a domestic market.
- Denominated in the local currency.

### 2. Eurobonds

Eurobonds are significant international bond issues, commonly utilized by governments and multinational corporations. Originating in 1963, the market expanded rapidly in the 1970s. Contrary to the name, "euro" does not restrict issuance to European financial centres, and these bonds are denominated in a currency different from the issuing centre.

**Characteristics:**
- Often issued in multiple financial centres simultaneously.
- Denominated in a currency different from the issuing centre.
- 'Euro' prefix originates from the Eurodollar market.
- Negative pledge clause prevents subordination of bondholders' interests to subsequent issues.

**Advantages of Eurobonds:**
- Offers a choice of innovative products.
- Enables tapping into international lenders.
- Provides anonymity to investors in bearer form.
- Offers gross interest payments.
- Lower funding costs due to market competitiveness and greater liquidity.
- Allows for short-notice bond issues with less regulation and disclosure.

**Common Types:**
- Conventional bonds ('straights'), FRNs, ZCBs, convertible bonds, and dual-currency bonds.
- Can feature a wide range of innovative characteristics.

## Yields
- Yields measure the returns on bonds and are crucial for investors.
- Coupon reflects the interest rate on the nominal amount, but the actual purchase price may differ.
- The bond's yield is the return percentage of the cost price.

**Flat Yield Calculation:**
- Flat yield is the interest paid on a bond as a percentage of its market price.
- Calculated by dividing the annual coupon by the bond's price, then multiplying by 100.
- Bond price is often stated as the price for a nominal value (e.g., US$100).

**Example:**
- Using a US Treasury bond with a 1.875% coupon and priced at US$96.18, the flat yield is calculated as (1.875 Ã· 96.18) x 100 = 1.95%.

**Total Return:**
- Interest earned on a bond is just one part of the total return.
- The investor may also make a capital gain or loss if holding the bond until redemption.

**Redemption Yield (Yield to Maturity):**
- Incorporates both income and capital return if the investor holds the bond until maturity.
- Combines flat yield and potential gain/loss for an average annual compound return.
- Provides a more accurate indication of the return and helps compare different bonds.

**Yield Curve:**
- Illustrates different interest rates for similar debt instruments with various maturity dates.
- In a positive yield curve (sloping upward), longer-term investments demand higher interest to compensate for greater risk and opportunity cost.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Yields measure returns on bonds, crucial for investors.
- Flat yield is the interest percentage based on the bond's market price.
- Redemption yield considers both income and capital return.
- Yield to maturity provides a more accurate indication of return.
- The yield curve shows interest rates for debt instruments with different maturity dates.

# 6-Derivatives 

Derivatives, with roots dating back centuries to agriculture, have evolved to become crucial financial instruments. They serve the purpose of managing uncertainties arising from factors such as overproduction or shortages.

## Types of Derivatives

Derivatives cover a broad spectrum, including commodities, financial instruments, indices, metals, and more. They play diverse roles, serving functions such as hedging, anticipating cash flows, adjusting asset allocation, engaging in arbitrage, and facilitating speculation.

## Key Derivative Instruments

### Futures

Futures enable standardized trading of assets at predetermined future prices. These binding agreements involve a buyer (long), a seller (short), an open position (initial trade), and a close (settling the contract).

### Options

Options grant the right (without obligation) to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. Common types include call options (buy) and put options (sell), with buyers as holders and sellers as writers.

### Interest Rate Swaps

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments. They are utilized to manage risks associated with variable interest rates.

### Credit Default Swaps (CDSs)

CDSs operate as insurance against credit risks. One party pays a premium to receive compensation in case of a credit event, such as default.

## Derivatives Trading

### Derivatives Exchanges

Derivatives can be traded on organized exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC). Examples of derivatives exchanges include CME Group, ICE, LME, and Eurex.

### Interaction with Physical Markets

Commodity markets, dealing in various goods, coexist with derivatives. Derivatives in commodities provide a means to fix prices and manage market risks.

## Considerations for Investing

# 8-Regulation and Ethics

## Introduction:

Understanding the intricacies of global financial regulations is paramount in the world of investments. In this passage, we'll delve into the vital role that integrity and ethics play in the finance landscape.

**Takeaway:** Knowing the rules in the finance world is crucial, and maintaining honesty and ethics is of utmost importance.

## The Need for Regulation:

Financial markets require rules to protect investors. As markets have expanded globally, the demand for common standards has led to international cooperation. Laws and regulations serve as the backbone, preventing financial disasters and instilling confidence in the markets.

**Takeaway:** Rules exist to safeguard against financial losses. International cooperation is essential, and regulations are crucial for preventing financial disasters.

## Authorization:

Imagine this: Offering financial services without approval is generally illegal. Regulators act as judges, evaluating firms to ensure they are fit and proper. They play the role of finance superheroes, scrutinizing factors like management and financial strength.

**Takeaway:** Firms need permission to operate in finance. Regulators ensure they meet certain standards to avoid disruptions.

## Regulatory Principles:

Governments establish regulators to ensure fairness, efficiency, and transparency. International cooperation and adherence to standards, such as those set by IOSCO, serve as the adhesive binding the global financial system. Regulators act as referees, ensuring adherence to rules, preventing misconduct, and maintaining financial stability.

**Takeaway:** Regulators globally promote fairness and transparency, preventing malpractice in finance. Following standards ensures a level playing field.

## Financial Crime:

Now, onto the dark side: money laundering. It involves transforming illicit funds into legitimate ones. We'll explore the stages, such as placement, layering, and integration. Anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, coupled with international cooperation, act as heroes combating this financial menace.

**Takeaway:** Money laundering disguises illegal funds as legal. International collaboration and AML efforts are pivotal in combating this threat.

## Terrorist Financing:

Hold tight, as terrorist financing is the sneakier cousin of money laundering. Involving smaller amounts, trickier tracking, and utilizing legitimate funds, it poses a significant challenge to detection.

**Takeaway:** Terrorists also need funds, and detecting their financial activities is challenging due to smaller amounts and the use of legal funds.

## Other Areas of Financial Crime:

Shifting focus to emerging threatsâ€”identity fraud and cybercrime. Identity fraud involves using someone's identity for criminal activities, while cybercrime spans sophisticated online attacks to traditional crimes in the digital realm.

**Takeaway:** Criminals are stealing identities and committing crimes online, costing a significant amount globally. Guarding personal information is paramount.

## 3. Insider Trading and Market Abuse:

### 3.1 Insider Trading:

Picture this: Company bigwigs buying or selling shares using secret company info â€“ that's insider dealing. It's a criminal act in most places, and you could face fines or end up in jail.

**Takeaway:** Don't mess with secret info for trading. It's a big no-no and can get you in serious trouble.

### 3.2 Market Abuse:

Market abuse occurs when investors get a raw deal due to underhanded moves. Activities like insider dealing and market manipulation can result in fines or even criminal charges.

**Takeaway:** Market abuse is a significant offense. Practices like insider dealing and market manipulation can lead to serious consequences.

## 4. Integrity and Ethics in Professional Practice:

### 4.1 Codes of Ethics, Codes of Conduct, and Regulation:

In finance, trust is paramount. Even with regulations, professional groups like CISI have their own codes of conduct. These codes set high expectations, requiring professionals to go beyond merely following the rules.

**Takeaway:** Maintaining ethical standards is crucial. Codes expect professionals to be top-notch, client-focused, adept at handling conflicts, and committed to continuous improvement.

# 9-Other Financial Products

## 1. Pensions

### 1.1 Retirement Planning
Retirement funds and homes are like superheroes for many folks. A pension is like a savings account for your golden years. You stash money there while working, and it gives you a lump sum when you retire, plus some yearly cash. It's cool because in many places, you pay less income tax while contributing. But when you get the pension, bam! The taxman shows up.

### 1.2 State Pension Schemes
Countries throw some cash to retired peeps through state pensions. But here's the kicker â€“ it's from the government's wallet, not some fancy investment. And guess what? People are living longer, which gives governments a headache. The UK, for example, expects more retirees than workers soon. That means less dough per head or more workers breaking their backs.

### 1.3 Corporate Retirement Schemes
Companies got creative with occupational pension schemes. They pitch in some dough for their employees' retirement. It's a win-win â€“ lower costs and happy employees. But wait, there's a twist. Old-school final salary schemes are out; they're costly. Now, it's all about defined contribution schemes. Your retirement cash depends on what you put in and how the investments perform. Risky, but it's the new cool.

### 1.4 Personal Pensions
Not everyone gets the corporate pension party. Enter personal pensions â€“ like your personal retirement piggy bank. You, the lone wolf or self-employed hero, set it up. It's your job to pick investments wisely because that pension life depends on it.

#### 1.4.1 Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
In the US, there's a special treat called IRAs. They're like personal pension schemes, but Uncle Sam gives you tax breaks for being a responsible adult.

## 2. Loans

### 2.1 Types of Borrowing
Borrowing money comes in three flavors: overdrafts, credit card magic, and good old loans.

#### 2.1.1 Overdrafts
Ever spent more than what's in your bank account? Welcome to the overdraft club. If it's approved, cool. If not, prepare for fees and grumpy bankers. Overdrafts are like that convenient but pricey friend you call only when desperate.

#### 2.1.2 Credit Card Borrowing
Credit cards â€“ the cool kids in the borrowing block. You buy stuff, and the credit card company foots the bill. Pay the full tab each month, and it's a free ride. Forget it, and the interest monster wakes up. It's like playing with fire, but with cool perks like 0% interest offers.

#### 2.1.3 Loans
Loans, the heavyweight champs of borrowing. Unsecured loans don't care what you buy, but they'll haunt you if you can't pay up. Secured loans, like mortgages, need collateral. Fail to pay, and they might take your house. Talk about serious business.

### 2.2 Interest Rates
Interest rates â€“ the bane of borrowers. Mortgages are the cheap date, credit cards are the expensive fling, and overdrafts are the penalties you regret. The trick? Check the real cost with the Effective Annual Rate (EAR). It's like the total bill, including all those hidden fees. And don't forget about APR â€“ the cool kid that shows you the real cost of borrowing.

## 3. Mortgages

### 3.1 Characteristics of the Property Market and Mortgages
Mortgages â€“ loans with your property as superhero collateral. People grab mortgages for cozy nests or even fancy vacation homes. 'Buy-to-let' is a thing too â€“ mortgage to be a landlord. But, property markets can be moody, and fees can bite. Making money from selling your home? No tax worries. Just remember, property isn't a guaranteed jackpot.

Lenders check you out for mortgages â€“ income, job security, bills. They size up the loan against your property's value, a fancy term â€“ 'loan-to-value ratio.' Secret: Second mortgage? First one gets paid first from the property sale if things go south.

### 3.2 Types of Mortgage
There's the 'repayment mortgage.' Pay monthly, chip away at both interest and the loan amount. It's a journey â€“ mostly interest early on, then slaying that loan principal. Keep up with payments, and you're golden. Watch for interest rate hikes or risking property loss if you skip payments. Mortgage's like a ninja tied to your property.

### 3.3 Payment Terms
Lenders play with interest rates:

- **Variable Rate Mortgages:** Your interest rate dances with the market â€“ up when it's high, down when it's low. Interest rate rollercoaster!

- **Fixed Rate Mortgages:** Lock in a sweet rate. Rates soar? You're the cool cat with the lower fixed rate. Drop? Breaking up with fixed rate comes with a cost.

- **Capped Rate Mortgages:** Rate safety net â€“ can't go beyond a certain level. Enjoy low tide if rates dive, safe under the cap if they spike.

- **Discounted Rate Mortgages:** Lenders give a discount â€“ savvy borrowers play the rate game.

### 3.4 Islamic Finance
Islamic finance â€“ banking with a conscience. No interest; it's about sharing risks and ethical money moves. Islamic mortgages are like cool friends using home purchase plans (HPPs).

In the UK, HPPs involve joint ownership and leasing. You and the bank buy the property together. Over time, you buy the bank's share. It's a partnership party! While not the full owner, you lease the bank's part and pay rent. Settle the bill, and the home's all yours.

Islamic finance â€“ making money moves with a heart.

## 4. Life Assurance

### 4.1 Basic Principles of Life Assurance

Insurance, the financial superhero from the insurance industry, steps in to shield individuals from life's unexpected events. Though details may vary by location, the core principles remain consistent.

**Life Policy 101:**
- An insurance policy for one event â€“ death.
- You pay premiums, and in return, there's life cover â€“ a lump sum paid when the inevitable happens.

Not all policies are the same. Some involve investments, calculating a sum from a guaranteed amount plus any profits during the policy period. Payout depends on the guaranteed sum, departure date, and investment fund performance.

Two main types of life cover: Whole-of-life assurance and Term assurance.

### 4.2 Whole-of-Life Assurance

This rockstar has three variations:
- **Non-profit:** Guarantees a sum â€“ no fancy investment.
- **With-profits:** A guaranteed amount plus extra from investment profits.
- **Unit-linked:** Returns ride the investment performance rollercoaster.

Why get these policies? Not just for the death payout, but also as part of a protection plan. Like, paying off a mortgage or having funds for taxes upon farewell. A financial sidekick â€“ part protection, part investment.

### 4.3 Term Assurance

Simpler â€“ a policy that throws a lump sum party if death RSVPs within a set time.
- Got a mortgage? Ensures funds are there to pay it off if you kick the bucket.
- Surviving partner? Gives them a lump sum for income or handling taxes post your grand exit.

You decide payout amount and coverage duration. If you're out during coverage, your chosen sum gets handed over. Some policies even throw the party early if you're diagnosed with a terminal illness expected to end the show within a year.

In a nutshell, life assurance â€“ your financial hero against life's curveballs.
